This folder has an experiment where with ONLY ONE SET OF PARAMETERS,

K33 = 30.0

Lambda = 600.0
omega = 20.0

This matches up with the coexistence line I was looking at in ../../2019-06-27/coexistence-gaps .

Default gamma and k24 values are 

k24 = 0.02554
gamma = 0.0348808.


I am looking at the double well behaviour of the energy along a line x(t) = x0+t*(x1-x0), where xi = (Ri,etai,deltai)'.
